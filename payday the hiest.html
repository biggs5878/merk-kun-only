    <p1>Payday the Hiest(pdth)  You and others are robbers its the start of the hiesting 
    crooks this game is the defintion of intense as 6 hiests are required for gold
    while the rest are pretty fun.First world bank,heat street, panic room,Green bridge,diamond hiest 
    and slaughterhouse the dlcs are undercover,counterfeit and no mercy(pc only).
    this game has got a great repatation rated pretty high on pc though consoles the four hiesters
    are dallas hox chains and wolf. easy,normal,hard and overkill are the diffculties 
    these are the basic as you except easy, then hard and very hard! 
    overkill+145 this is considered super advanced as moving with your team
    and the spawns of cops on +145 can be over whemmling as the damage output plus the amount of downs
    communication and teamwork,  but the hard intense gameplay make this game what its meant to be and it is loved
    by all for that reason.</p1>
