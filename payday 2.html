    <hr><!--splits up the title and h1 from the paragraph-->
    <p1>Payday 2 this game is the defintion of awesome fun its not as intense as 1 if you don't include goat simulator (a hiest)
   more or less while that is true, The game is very random it brought back classics as First world bank, Panic Room, 
    and Slaughterhouse,Undercover,Counterfeit.Updated them a bit nothing to new and serveral new hiests
    this game has got a good repatation rated pretty average on pc though consoles old gene far behind with new gene catching up
    the four hiesters are back with new characters this is considered much casual then 1 and dlc heavy as moving with your team
    and the spawns of cops are not over whemmling even on deathwish as the damage output plus the amount of downs 
    communication in 1 is heavy then 2 but teamwork works the same. However on One Down can be tough without it as it is just as overkill +145,
    even if that is true this game has been popular with the public and how many players met new people during the time in
    its own weird way makes this game what its meant  but to be looking forward to payday 3 is in mind also.:3</p1>
